## How to use application.

### API.
Endpoint can run using built in 
[PhpStorm HTTP Client](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html) and
`.http` files where sample itself is configured.

It can be found in `requests/v1/best-sellers-history.http`. But to run endpoint, we need to configure
 environment a bit:
- Make a copy of file `http-client.private.env.json.dist` in the `requests` directory. File name
must be `http-client.private.env.json`:

- In created file set client variable `local.appHost` with the host of application on your environment.
- Open file `requests/v1/best-sellers-history.http` and select environment `local`:
